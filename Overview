We live in the Sixth age of Man. In our Age, magic is forbidden to Mankind by the Sidhe. This has forced us to use natural laws instead of magic. Some in high positions collaborate with the Sidhe to keep us ignorant of magic. In previous Ages, Magic, once discovered, was used for everything. There was no need of the natural sciences. The five Ages before ours were destroyed by the overuse of magic. 

Magic takes energy in the form of heat from the Earth. This has been known since the third age. Small amounts of magic have no discernible effect. Large uses create localized cooling however. Such as summoning a demon, lifting a sufficiently large stone, or teleportation to very distant places.  

People are not able to limit their wants so magic is always overused. In the Third and Fourth age, men tried to limit their use of magic. By tyrannical force, law, and custom, magic was controlled in use... to protect the planet. But all attempts came to naught.  The worse things get, the more people rely on magic, and the more people rely on magic, the worse things get. So another ice age always begins.

Each ice age resets the board, magic is lost, and the planet can warms back up. Once magic is rediscovered however, the chain of events always culminates in an ice age that slaughters everyone. Because when things are great, people overuse magic for luxury, and when things go bad, people use it to survive. Until the planet in plunged into another ice age.
