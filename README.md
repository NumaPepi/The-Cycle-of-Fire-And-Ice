# The Cycle of Fire and Ice

*A collaborative open-source fantasy universe by John Pepin*

Welcome to **The Cycle of Fire and Ice**, an open shared universe where anyone can write stories, build lore, or create new characters — as long as they stick to established canon.

This world has seen **five great civilizations rise and fall**, each destroyed by its own overuse of magic. Magic, while powerful, draws heat from the Earth itself. Each time it flourishes unchecked, it triggers another Ice Age.

We now live in the **Sixth Age**, where magic is suppressed by the Sidhe, and humanity survives through technology rather than will. But the secrets of the past are always trying to break through.
